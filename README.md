## Problem
Young students have difficulty staying focused and motivated while in a remote education environment. While the pandemic may eventually end, remote education will likely continue to grow as a solution for those in rural environments or without adequate school districts nearby. For example, Lincoln Public Schools has created a remote-learning option for the 2021-2022 school year, even though vaccines are expected to be distributed to the general public by summer 2021. [200 students](https://www.klkntv.com/lps-to-launch-new-remote-learning-program/) have already chosen this option.

## Solution
Gamification (research behind why gamification works)

(Our proposal for simple gamification - Based on points won from completing assignments, students can choose aspects of their page on Google Classroom to personalize (background color, font color, font style, background images, etc.))

(What can be expanded upon and done in the future)

## Technical Implementation
Chrome extension
Access CSS properties to change visual aspects of the page
